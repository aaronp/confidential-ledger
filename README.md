# Confidential Ledger

This is an example of a "spreadsheet", which is essentially the
equivalent to an ERC-20 token -- that is, a mapping of balances to
accounts.

In tihs example, we show how everyone can see their own balance, 
but not the balance of the other holders, but can see what the 
total fund balance is.

It's an example of how data can be shared amongst participants, 
while still protecting everyone's privacy
