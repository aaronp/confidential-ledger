# Phase F1 ‚Äî Private Balances / Public Totals Ledger

> **Goal:** Shared ledger with per-user privacy and global auditability.

---

## Overview

Phase F1 implements a cryptographic ledger system where:
- Each participant's balance remains **private** (visible only to them)
- The **total** across all participants is **publicly verifiable**
- No central authority can see individual balances
- Everyone can verify the ledger's integrity

This is achieved using Pedersen-style commitments with encrypted "openings" per holder.

---

## Features

### Core Capabilities

1. **Pedersen-style commitments per participant**
   - Each balance is represented as a cryptographic commitment
   - Commitments hide the value while allowing mathematical operations
   - Homomorphic properties enable summing commitments

2. **Encrypted "openings" per holder**
   - Each participant holds an encrypted opening revealing their balance
   - Only the participant can decrypt and verify their own balance
   - Openings prove the commitment corresponds to the claimed value

3. **Public verification of total correctness**
   - Sum of all commitments can be verified against the total
   - Anyone can audit that the ledger balances correctly
   - No need to see individual values

4. **Optional self-update flag for local demos**
   - Participants can self-update their balances in demo mode
   - Useful for testing and local development
   - Real deployments use governance rules for updates

## Impact & Dependencies

**Impact:** üí∞ **High**
Enables money, budgets, and trust visualisation ‚Äî foundational for financial use-cases.

**Effort:** ‚öôÔ∏è **Medium**
PoC already exists, needs productionisation and integration.

**Dependencies:**
- F0 (Core Skeleton) must be complete

**Feeds into:**
- F2 ‚Äî EyamCoin (community tokens)
- F3 ‚Äî Budgets & Expense Governance
- F4 ‚Äî Fundraising & Pledges

## Technical Architecture

### State Model

```ts
interface PrivateBalanceLedger {
  id: LedgerId;
  participants: Map<AID, ParticipantEntry>;
  totalCommitment: Commitment;
  rules: LedgerRules;
}

interface ParticipantEntry {
  commitment: Commitment;      // Public: C = g^v ¬∑ h^r
  encryptedOpening: Encrypted; // Private: {value, blinding}
  lastUpdated: Timestamp;
}
```

### Event Types

```ts
type LedgerEvent =
  | { type: 'ledger.created'; ledgerId: LedgerId; rules: LedgerRules }
  | { type: 'participant.added'; aid: AID; initialCommitment: Commitment }
  | { type: 'balance.updated'; aid: AID; newCommitment: Commitment; proof: Proof }
  | { type: 'total.verified'; totalCommitment: Commitment; valid: boolean };
```

### State Transitions

All state transitions must be:
- **Deterministic:** Same events ‚Üí same state
- **Verifiable:** Signed by authorized participants
- **Auditable:** Full event log retained
- **Testable:** Golden snapshots for every transition

---

## Verification Protocol

### Adding a Participant

1. Participant generates initial commitment `C = g^v ¬∑ h^r`
2. Stores encrypted opening `E_k({v, r})`
3. Broadcasts commitment to ledger
4. Total commitment updated: `Total' = Total ¬∑ C`

### Updating a Balance

1. Participant generates new commitment `C'`
2. Proves knowledge of old opening (ZK proof)
3. Provides range proof (optional: balance ‚â• 0)
4. Updates encrypted opening
5. Ledger updates participant's commitment
6. Total commitment adjusted accordingly

### Public Verification

Anyone can verify:
```
Sum(all_commitments) == TotalCommitment
```

Without learning any individual balance.

---

## Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Local Group Budget
- 5 participants each contribute different amounts
- Each sees only their own balance
- All can verify the total matches expected sum
- Treasurer can audit without seeing individual contributions

### Scenario 2: Salary Confidentiality
- Organization publishes total salary budget commitment
- Employees verify their individual salaries
- Public can verify organization doesn't exceed budget
- Individual salaries remain private

---

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Define ledger state schema
- [ ] Implement Pedersen commitment primitives
- [ ] Create encrypted opening mechanism
- [ ] Build state transition functions
- [ ] Add ZK proof verification
- [ ] Write golden snapshot tests
- [ ] Create CLI inspector tool
- [ ] Build minimal UI for balance viewing
- [ ] Document cryptographic protocol
- [ ] Add self-update mode for demos

---

## Testing Strategy

### Golden Snapshot Tests

Every state transition must have golden test:
- Initial ledger creation
- Adding first participant
- Adding multiple participants
- Balance updates (increase/decrease)
- Total verification
- Error cases (invalid proofs, unauthorized updates)

### Property-Based Tests

- Homomorphic property: `C1 ¬∑ C2 = C(v1 + v2)`
- Total always equals sum of parts
- No negative balances (with range proofs)
- Replay protection (nonces/timestamps)

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Commitment Binding**
   - Once committed, value cannot be changed without detection
   - Requires discrete log hardness

2. **Opening Privacy**
   - Encrypted with participant's key
   - Only participant can decrypt
   - Loss of key = loss of balance proof

3. **Range Proofs**
   - Prevent negative balances
   - Prevent overflow attacks
   - Optional based on use-case

4. **Replay Protection**
   - Events include nonces or timestamps
   - Prevents double-application of updates

---

## Success Criteria

Phase F1 is complete when:

1. ‚úÖ Ledger can be created with multiple participants
2. ‚úÖ Each participant can see only their own balance
3. ‚úÖ Anyone can verify the public total
4. ‚úÖ Balance updates are cryptographically sound
5. ‚úÖ All state transitions have passing golden tests
6. ‚úÖ CLI tool can inspect ledger state
7. ‚úÖ UI can display private balance + public total
8. ‚úÖ Documentation explains the protocol clearly

---

## Next Steps

After F1 completion:
- **F2** builds token semantics on top of this ledger
- **F3** uses ledger for budget tracking
- **F4** leverages it for pledge/fundraising transparency

Phase F1 is the **financial foundation** of Ferits.
